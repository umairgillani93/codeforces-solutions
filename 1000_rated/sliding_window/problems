Beginner Level (Fixed-Size Sliding Window)
Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
Find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size K.
Variation: Find the minimum sum subarray of size K.

First Negative Number in Every Window of Size K
Given an array with positive and negative numbers, find the first negative number in each window of size K.
Variation: Replace missing negatives with 0 if no negative exists in a window.

Count Occurrences of Anagram (Permutation in a String)
Find all occurrences of an anagram of s1 in s2 using a fixed sliding window.

üîÑ Intermediate Level (Variable-Size Sliding Window)
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Find the length of the longest substring with unique characters.
Variation: Find the actual substring, not just its length.

Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring containing at most K distinct characters.

Smallest Subarray with Sum ‚â• X
Find the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is at least X.
Variation: Find the largest subarray with sum at most X.

Fruits into Baskets (Sliding Window with Two Pointers)
Find the longest contiguous subarray where you can pick at most two different types of fruits.
Hint: This is a variable-size window problem, equivalent to "Longest Subarray with At Most 2 Distinct Characters."

üöÄ Advanced Level (Optimized Sliding Window & Two Pointers)
Minimum Window Substring
Find the smallest substring in s that contains all characters of t.
Hint: Use two pointers and frequency maps.

Longest Subarray with Equal Number of 0s and 1s
Given a binary array, find the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.
Variation: Instead of 0s and 1s, use any two given numbers.

Sliding Window Median
Find the median of each window of size K in an array.
Hint: Use a balanced data structure like a multiset or two heaps (max heap + min heap).

Longest Subarray with Sum Divisible by K
Find the longest contiguous subarray whose sum is divisible by K.

Find K Unique Characters with the Most Frequency
Find the K most frequent unique characters in a string within a sliding window.
Hint: Use frequency maps + sliding window.

Max Consecutive Ones III
Find the longest contiguous subarray with at most K zeroes that can be flipped to 1.
Hint: Use the two-pointer approach.

üèÜ Final Step: Implement & Master
Try solving these problems on:

LeetCode: Search for problems under "Sliding Window" tag.
Codeforces: Look for problems involving substrings, subarrays, and constraints like "at most K" or "minimum sum."
AtCoder: Look for range query problems.
üí° Bonus:
Once you're comfortable, try implementing monotonic queues or deque-based optimizations for sliding window maximum/minimum problems.
